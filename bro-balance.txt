~~ CURRENT PONDERINGS ~~
Demon + Padding lets Demon spend that HP too freely and is maybe strong?  (test)

Tongue maybe down to 40% and another ~ -2 on price?  (probably wants to remain +10 of Frog, so either 35/45 or 30/40)


Crash bug - probably alongside some other mod, happening when going from wave to shop
Incompatability: "Catato character from Patamods has nullified damage, which doesn't work together with this mod. I found one other instance, but I forget from where.
Random bonus effects like Eden from the Binding of Isaac mod, and Retromation's Infinite Character doesn't work with this mod either."

Patamods
Extatonion

~~~ LOW PRIORITY (All things I'd like to add/look at but are less essential) ~~~
Bull + Robot Arm -- may incorrectly report Bull damage on the weapon?

Cyborg: Unique SFX when switching modes (rather than an already used sound)
	Vanilla appears to only make a sound incidentally as part of the stat_added signal?
	
Should crit chance tooltip mention explosions can crit?

Double negative from -%Dmg and Negative Elemental Damage results in a positive damage scaling for burn.

King's changed abilities show the total in green instead of white at +0

Sifd's could give partial {some stat} based on Pickup Range
	Could damage enemies the materials pass thru on their way to you {check if mat is moving and then just check hitboxes??}

Farmer/Streamer and Explorer/Fisher/Cryptid descriptions for fewer mats should probably be consistent (tho there's the awkwardness of the long version being more accurate and the short version being better for the tiny text box)

Could flatten Pruner's dmg level-ups, e.g. 50/70/85 for scaling or 60/70/85, and 1.4/1.6/1.8 for crit dmg
Pruners could have a more Xbow-like Crit-scaling
	Pruners already pretty good tho, so might need small base/scaling nerfs or something alongside
	
PowerGen & Speedy don't know how to read Fairy's LinkedStats -Speed
Likewise Chonky doesn't see Stone Skin HP
-Stone Skin could account for armor from Streamer's bonus since it *is* basically permanent armor (it can change via weapon changes, but not once the wave starts?)

should potato be tagged for all its stuff rather than an arbitrary subset? (Was there a reason like, as far as having at least 1 red item for each of those tags or?)

Explorer _could_ be tagged for Speed (but would make Bags a touch harder to find.)

Multitasker Weapons slot UI 2x3 -> 3x4??
	Make it switch whenever you have more than 6 weapons to also work for Robot Arm
	
Rework Riposte

jousting lance progression looks sus, esp. purple; try it with some more chars

farmer xbow?
Speedy: -Screwdriver starts maybe?

Arms Dealer could have %Damage Tag and/or Economy Tag (Is Coupon extra good or bad on them?)

can we show explosion size in the weapon info?
	Look at get_text in weapon_stats
	Also get_lifesteaL-text to maybe show the 0% for weapons that have base LS
		^Weapons that start with Lifesteal should show Lifesteal in red even if they're at 0%

in func set_damage, new_value definition being defined as int before being rounded causes it to always truncate, or? (Supposedly this means rounding is different for projectile damage than for melee hits)

SMG tier-1 (and tier-2) scaling worse (maybe do this moreso instead of the cooldown hit) [but learn properly how the scaling/rounding works;it's rude if 2 ranged damage doesn't increase]
	Appears to be Ranged Damage is always truncated, and Damage% is rounded, and they are separate; could maybe combine them but then truncate, or? [Verify formula, then chart out a few sample breakpoint spots, probably just for early-game]
	
Entreprenuer Harvesting tooltip incorrectly still says 5% when it is 7.5% (verify)

Farmer tooltip should count how much harvesting gained

"Items Price" Text -> "Shop Price" [Seems kinda difficult; would need to use a different text name in code and also adjust the shop scene?]

Could there be a change to make it easier to find matching tier-2 weapons when you start with one like Potato? [Would this be ignored for King?]
	Would prob. only be for Waves 2-5, but something like an extra luck roll for non-tier-1 if you have... a blue weapon?  or specifically pot thrower/sword/hammer/etc.?
	
Burn currently doesn't apply to trees dying in 8 hits, but should -- possible solution would be having a separate check for burn to kill the tree after 5-6 ticks; alternatively could apply all duration ticks to the hit-count immediately when it gets hit (or half+1 or whatever seems sensible)

Make Jack's EnemyDamage and EnemyHP multiplicative, so it works more correctly for lower Danger Levels & Accessibility Settings.  E.g. 'change it to +175% HP, and +35% Damage' [Difficult since DangerLevel is the same value as Jack's bonus so is inherently additive; works for Accessibility but that'd be only a half fix...]

Structures When Reloading a Save: "When you resume the game after having quit, structures lose their ties to items or weapons. So if you have 2 Wrench, you can reload the game, and the structure is disconnected from the structure. So now you can combine those 2 wrenches, and 2 tier one turrets and one blue turret will spawn. Same goes with all other items and weapons that spawn structures."

Soldier: "Melee Weapons sometimes don’t benefit from the +50% damage, which shouldn’t be the case, since you shouldn’t be able to attack if you’re moving. I think the issue stems from attack animation, if the check deciding if you’re allowed to attack happens before the damage of the attack is calculated, then there is a timing window where you could begin to move."

Sausage appears to be having some of its damage counted on weapons *instead*.  Also had Alien Eyes, Burn Turrents, Tyler, Eyes Surgery x3, regular turret if any of that matters

Giant's Belt double-logs damage numbers (itself and weapon) - fix to only show on belt
	I think this is also true for Sausage, and furthermore Sausage claims its +1 burn damage even for ticks that would happen after an enemy is already dead?
	
Could make mat drop %s per-mat instead of all-or-nothing

Maybe replace all instances of "materials" to actually mean gold, and add "XP" to the ones that don't?

Extra Stomach should work on Golem when not at max HP. (Currently they can only ever get 1 max hp at most per wave.)
	This seemed like it'd be difficult to implement; would probably have like, a RunData variable to track if you've taken damage in a wave, and if not let golem eat?  Alternatively would have to make max_hp gains still heal you, but the healing seems to not know the source easily unless it can be gotten via the tracking stuff?

Fix the "x2" material popup to say the correct x## amount?
	this might be the gold.boosted value, that's set to 2 rather than += 1?

Lucky Coin: Should this scale Luck off two axies instead of only Crit?  Seems overly situational; possibly retooled as a purple-tier

prolly fix lifesteal tooltip to be accurate to how it actually works

bull should report damage
bull's tooltip should prob include crit chance if not too hard


~~~ GRAVEYARD (Probably not going to use these ideas, but left for posterity) ~~~
Should Renegade be tagged for Ranged Damage? [Already kinda strong enough without it, tho could potentially also get some minor nerf at the same time; would also make it slightly harder to find varied tier-1s]

Should Sharp Bullet be part of the Ranged Damage tag set like Bandana is? (Or, piercing Tag could be given to Ranged & Engineering build types?) [Thinking no, since it's still plenty common enough]

Should one-armed have Harvesting Tag? (Tho Bee can be rough)

Glutton melee damage tag is a bit weird but maybe fine.  (Kinda dumb for both Jousting and Shredder)

weapon preference could also have part it based on damage types; e.g. 5-10% of the roll checks based on two flat damage types you have the most of (counting melee as x2), starting at maybe Wave 7?

chameleon arguably better to _not_ be tagged for dodge [probably leaving tho]

Smoothed enemy spawns from -Enemies (like Trees) would probably be good, rather than random (so e.g. Jack would get 1 or 2 fish from a Bait, never randomly 4) [This is messy and changes the current spawn amounts significantly; it'd require kind of a weird rework to be implemented]

[?]Doctor: -100% Attack Speed -> -50%; +200% Attack Speed with Medical Weapons -> +150%

Luck could maybe affect your same-weapon-finding shop bonus slightly too? 

Could slightly lower Laser Gun's cooldown (and probably also base damage?) to let it get 1 extra shot off Wave 1 and 2, so it doesn't get quite as bad of a starting economy hit
	--> would have to be 105->93 cooldown, below current purple-tier, so probably a no-go; just means you're out ~8mats wave 1

Rebalancing Elemental over a 2-per-levelup ratio may ultimately end up making more sense, letting burn damage keep up with the pace of the game better

Egg - 5 base/3 per wave -> 2 base 3.5 per wave or something?  [Aiming for slightly less on 7, a touch more later]

One-armed could Maybe also double Engineering (or 50%)

Fix AtkSpd being stored as int prematurely, store as float [doesn't actually change anything on its own, needs more]

Could add a pickup-range-only tag to Explorer and Streamer

Is it reasonable to make lifesteal/burn/crit/special effects (e.g. tooth) feel more consistent as to what counts for them?

Elemental set bonus could give a Snake effect for 4or5 in a set?

Red weapons could perhaps not contribute to 'increased weapon find chance'

One-armed, Arms Dealer, Engineer, Entrepreneur, Lich: Description should say "All Damage" to be more clear it applies to every Damage type.

* Bounces (e.g. from Lightning Shiv) should be able to target Bosses like they do other enemies.
* The game should fully stop recognizing the mouse while using controller. (Currently, it will highlight whatever the mouse would be hovering over, so it can look like an option is selected when it isn't.)
* Tooltips for capped stats incorrectly report on your stats, e.g. it can imply your movement speed is faster than it actually is when you have Shackles. [Ideally the tooltip should change to clarify "you would be moving X% faster/slower, but your speed is capped at Y%"]
* Dangerous Bunny: If the current shop already costs 0 to reroll, 

Knockback: Now also reduces speed of enemies charging at you rather than those enemies being completely immune. A starting concept (obviously may need tweaks after testing and further adjustments to weapon knockback values): Enemy charges are now slowed by attacks based on the attack's Knockback stat. Each hit additively reduces the speed of a charge until it hits a minimum speed (and it starts over for every new charge).
	A charge reaches it's cap (maximum speed reduction) when attacks totaling 50 have been applied, with each attack applying it's Knockback stat - 2 (min 0). The maximum reduction is: -50% for Charger, Horned Charger, & Lamprey; -40% for Bruiser & Horned Bruiser; -30% for Elites. For example, a Charger that is hit by a Wrench (Knockback 20) while charging would have the speed of that charge reduced to 82% of its normal speed for the remaining duration of the charge.

Screwdriver could be Explosive tagged

Applying additional burn could cause damage tick to happen immediately (not my favorite tweak but maybe)

* If you have acquired a combined 6+ items tagged Engineering or +Engineering Levelups, or if you are weilding 5+ Tool Weapons: the character is now treated as if they have the 'Engineering' Tag for the rest of the run.

Magician HP and move speed slightly lower which will cover some of the increased Helmet HP; value Helmet HP about half as much?



~QoL / UI~

* Turrets (and Wrenches spawning turrets) should track damage dealt.
* Items should show both total damage and damage during the previous wave.
* Piggy Bank should show materials saved for Entreprenuer (probably just a special case that makes it show difference from 0% instead of difference to 100%).


~~~ MOD IDEAS ~~~
-> Clarity UI / Misc QoL:
	HP above head bigger and always on
	Louder 'take damage' sfx ; quieter weapons (esp SMG)
	Cyborg: Unique SFX when switching modes (rather than an already used sound); Golem indicator for mode switch too
-> Lifesteal tracker mod
Show the actual player hitbox instead of a circle at the bottom?
Mod to track deaths per character and per wave (where you died)
+XP Gain Value chart->mod [Chart needs to be finished first]
Border highlight for items you care about paying attention to.  [Would this all be manual per-item, probably?  Apply to recurring effects like Anvil, separate color for damage items like Alien Eyes or Cyberball...]
Show actual stat gains in parentheses for items/levels (E.g. Hunter nothing from Harvest, or extra HP on Chunky, etc.)
	There is a mod that does this, but as a replace rather than a parenthetical: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689
Show effective actual scaling based on current? natural? cooldown (So instead of "100% Melee Damage Scaling" it'd show 125% for a weapon with a 0.8 cooldown) 
Can Elite projectiles be made a diff color?
Loot Alien more stand out


~~~ TO TEST~~~
Test: Verify Incindiary Turret is a different kind of burn that stacks with regular burn (Edit turret page with this if so)
Test: DPS variance for melee from more range (lots of speed to just circle a wave 9 or something)
Test: Snake meaingful effect (maybe Wand and Flamethrower?)
Test: Landmines random clear (compare mat counts?)
Does Metal Detector give you extra consumeables for Extra Stomach??
More precise elite pattern speed breakpoints
Test money gained from gentle alien [Also on Pacifist, Jack specifically]
Check if Jack gets extra consumeable drops to make up for their low enemy count (code implies there's no such effect)
Piercing med turret do anything?
Sausage wtf didn't register any damage why 
code look does blue turret actually stack with fire
Cute MOnkey/Lucky proc one or multi times from a x2+ material?  [Edit Monkey to be 100% test at non-full HP]
Peacock + Negative Armor stacking?
Ugly Tooth doesn't get applied from Burn/Lucky?  (verify)
Check Riposte-killed enemies drop mats as normal
Does temp Attack Speed from Streamer/Soldier work for Claw/Hatchet?
Negative speed can be positive with Shackles?
** Sick is tagged for Lifesteal, but starts with so much they barely benefit I think?  (Test) -- could tag Attack Speed [maybe cancel adding Improved Tools to the tag if so, or?] instead or in addition to [Could also lower their starting LS to 20%?]
** Does WanderBot delay enemy scripts? (Maybe count how many script attacks an Elite does with several Bots and without)
** ""Why melee weapons try to explode twice? One in collision handling in _on_Hurtbox_area_entered of unit.gd and second in _on_Hitbox_hit_something of weapon.gd afterhitbox.hit_something(self, dmg_taken[1]) called and then hitbox emits "hit_something" signal (This obviously doesn't happen for ranged weapons because hitbox belongs to a projectile and not a weapon). And if this is intended why _on_Hitbox_hit_something do not connect explosion to on_weapon_hit_something and lose tracking of damage?""
Test if Fisher/etc. with -mats end up GAINING more from there being piles on the ground (reverse of Jack bug)
coupon can show negative saved?? (was entrepreneur) [is it from the lowered value of recycled thing?]
Boss HP seemed to not get the +40% from Danger-5 despite the print-to-console saying they do (e.g., a Wave-2 Elite that should have 1051 HP, which is what their max-hp was said to be in the console, only appears to have 751.  This may be a conflict with adding the elite via the debug tho?)
